# Market Analysis

## TAM / SAM / SOM

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 2.6 million Australian SMEs lose **$38.6B annually** to operational friction—manual handoffs, lost context, fragmented systems.

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM):** 1.2 million SMEs in friction-heavy sectors: legal, finance, healthcare, NDIS, and compliance-led services. These are process-reliant businesses with clear stakes in efficiency and accuracy.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** 420,000 digitally ready firms with clear, quantified admin pain. We qualify them by a friction index: >30% of team time spent on non-billable work. At an average contract value of $33,300, this unlocks a **$14B immediate revenue opportunity** for outcome-led AI deployment.

## Target Segmentation

SrvdNeat targets SMEs that are willing but blocked. We call them:

**AI-Curious but Stuck**

They exhibit three core traits:

- **Mindset:** Want automation, but distrust generic consultants or freelance builders
- **Behavior:** Have tried AI tools (e.g. chatbots, Zapier) and quit due to complexity or low ROI
- **Conditions:** Founder-led ops, regulatory complexity, and manual workflows that break at scale

These aren't laggards. They're early adopters with friction. They don't need more AI tools — they need an intelligent partner to remove the blockers.

## Why Now: SrvdNeat's Moment

**AI isn't too early for SMEs—it's already here, and it's already failing.**

- **65% of Australian SMEs** report stalled or failed AI projects
- **80% of owners** see AI as vital for customer reach and competitiveness
- **63% use AI weekly**, but only for shallow tasks like admin support or basic visuals

**The problem isn't interest—it's integration.** SMEs are drowning in tools but starving for outcomes. Today's AI "adoption" is fragmented and tactical: vendors pitch isolated solutions that skim above broken workflows. What's missing is infrastructure—the connective tissue that diagnoses friction, aligns systems, and enables AI that actually works.

## Timing Tailwinds: July 2025 Is a Generational Moment

SrvdNeat launches at the collision point of two structural shifts:

### 1. $185B Federal AI Infrastructure Initiative (July 2025)

OpenAI and the Australian Government have made a landmark commitment to **fixing SME execution barriers**—the exact domain SrvdNeat was built to solve.

- Focuses on SME enablement, operational readiness, and orchestration
- Attacks fragmentation—not just by adding more tools
- Directly mirrors SrvdNeat's friction-first model, almost word for word

### 2. From AI Hype to AI Accountability

The market has matured. SMEs are no longer dazzled by demos:

- Prototypes don't cut it
- Leaders want embedded, measurable outcomes
- **SrvdNeat delivers execution, not theatre**

## Sector Momentum: The Wave Is Breaking Now

- **Professional Services Surge:** Legal, finance, and admin-heavy SMEs are driving an **11.4% CAGR** in automation software—no signs of slowing
- **Government-Subsidised Adoption:** Programs like the Digital Solutions Program and Industry Growth Fund are de-risking AI investment for SMEs
- **Post-COVID Infrastructure Maturity:** Digitisation grants have primed systems—but execution still fails
- **Affordable Orchestration:** Model and infra costs are finally within SME reach
- **Workforce Pressure:** Labour shortages, burnout, and compliance fatigue are accelerating urgency

**Adoption is no longer the hurdle—execution is.** AI tools are everywhere. But **with <30% success rates**, the market has made one thing clear: **tools don't transform. Infrastructure does.**
