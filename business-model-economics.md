# Business Model & Economics

## Pricing Tiers & ACV Breakdown

SrvdNeat employs a tiered subscription model designed to scale with the complexity of SME operations, rather than simply headcount. The key changes per tier are as followed:

- **Core:** internal, non-branded AI efficiency tools (frameworks to amplify effective work)
- **Plus:** internal, branded AI efficiency tools (internal infranet/chat etc)
- **App/Scale:** Outward facing, branded AI deployments

| **Tier** | **Monthly** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Core | $1.5K | Basic agent deployment + NeatPortal access |
| Plus | $3K | Multi-agent orchestration + industry templates |
| App/Scale | $4.5K+ | Full orchestration, comprehensive support, and compliance wrap |

- **Blended ACV:** $33.3K AUD
- **Average onboarding to activation:** Less than 7 days
- **Average agent deployment timeline:** 24–48 hours

Our pricing is value-anchored: clients pay for the measurable elimination of friction, not for arbitrary "seats" or "features" or unpredictable, often-spiking API pings.

## Unit Economics & Payback Period

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Gross Margin | 85% |
| CAC (est. Year 1) | $7.9K |
| LTV | $100K |
| LTV:CAC | 4.2x |
| Payback Period | 8 months |

Efficiency is projected to increase post-raise due to the maturation of our Go-to-Market (GTM) engine and enhanced agent reuse. Our high margin is protected by an in-house orchestration engine, minimizing reliance on outsourced development.

## Revenue Forecast & Customer Ramp

| **Month** | **Clients** | **Monthly ARR** | **Annual ARR** | **Cumulative Revenue** | **Key Milestones** |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | 0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | Seed funding secured |
| 6 | 10 | $27,750 | $333K | $162K | Product-market fit |
| 12 | 25 | $69,375 | $832.5K | $588K | Case studies and PMF confirmed |
| 18 | 45 | $124,875 | $1.4985M | $1.2M | GTM scaling phase |
| 24 | 60 | $166,500 | $1.998M | $2.1M | Series A milestone |
| 30 | 80 | $222,000 | $2.664M | $3.16M | Network effect kicks in |
| 36 | 110 | $305,250 | $3.663M | $5.9M | Vertical dominance begins |

- **Average Contract Value (ACV):** $33.3K
- **Gross Margin:** 85%
- **Revenue Mix:** 90% recurring, 10% setup/custom integrations
- **Break-even:** Approximately Month 20

## Capital Efficiency & Use of Funds

### $2M Seed Round Allocation

| **Category** | **Allocation** | **Amount (AUD)** | **Strategic Purpose** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Go-to-Market (GTM)** | 50% | $1,000,000 | Build repeatable acquisition engine: content, lead gen, sales automation, partnerships |
| **Infrastructure** | 20% | $400,000 | Scale NeatLM orchestration, deploy agent chaining, invest in data infrastructure |
| **Team Expansion** | 20% | $400,000 | Hire CTO and Head of Growth + support roles to scale product and GTM delivery |
| **Operating Buffer** | 10% | $200,000 | Preserve 24-month runway; ensure flexibility for reallocation based on signal |

This allocation is intentionally biased toward **distribution and delivery**, not experimentation. The model is working. This capital scales what's already proven.

### Land > Expand > Compound Model

- **Land:** Initiate with a free NeatAudit to quantify and highlight potential ROI during the initial meeting. Deploy 1–2 high-impact agents (e.g., for onboarding, billing, or compliance)
- **Expand:** Introduce multi-agent workflows (e.g., integrating onboarding → billing → follow-up processes). Activate NeatPortal for client-side usage and deeper engagement
- **Compound:** Behavioral data continuously feeds our learning loop. Usage patterns trigger new intervention prompts, and margins expand without a proportional increase in headcount

This model creates a virtuous cycle: the more clients we serve, the more precise our interventions become, and the faster we can acquire new clients.
