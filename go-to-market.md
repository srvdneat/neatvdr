# Go-To-Market Strategy

## Entry via Free Audit Model

Our Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy is structured in phases to ensure sustainable growth and market penetration:

- **0–6 Months (Validation):** Focus on founder-led sales and securing initial pilot wins. Target Outcome: $250K ARR from 10–12 clients
- **6–12 Months (Scale):** Develop a robust content engine and test various channel strategies. Target Outcome: $1M ARR run-rate, with established playbook repeatability
- **12–24 Months (Distribution):** Implement partner programs and further automate sales processes. Target Outcome: $2M ARR, preparing for a Series A funding round

This phased execution ensures early product-market fit, followed by scalable growth through predictable friction segments.

## Sales Channels & Partner Plays

### Founder-Led Sales
Targeted outreach to high-friction segments, particularly in legal and financial services. This approach aims for a 30–40% conversion rate from audit to deal.

### Content Engine
Development of diagnostic-style lead magnets, industry-specific friction benchmarks, and compelling founder narratives supported by case study storytelling.

**Content Strategy Examples:**

Our content strategy is designed to **educate, qualify, and convert** the "AI-Curious but Stuck" segment through high-trust, high-context materials. Core content assets include:

**E-books / Guides:**
- *"The Friction Economy: What It's Costing Your Firm"*
- *"AI Without the Chaos: A Guide for Professional Services SMEs"*
- *"The SME Friction Index: Benchmarking Your Operations"*

**Founder-Led Narratives:**
- *Postmortems of failed AI deployments and what we learned*
- *Before/after client stories with ROI metrics and time-to-value curves*
- *Behind-the-scenes: Building behavioral AI for real-world SME workflows*

**Interactive Tools:**
- Free Friction Assessment Calculator
- ROI projection tools based on audit results
- Industry-specific friction benchmarks and reports

### Partnerships
Collaboration with member organizations (e.g., Law Society, Accounting bodies) to offer white-labeled NeatAudit for trusted distribution. This includes shared-revenue or bundled offers.

SrvdNeat enhances associations and networks by giving them actionable AI value to pass on to members—without the risk of recommending generic tooling. Benefits include:

- **Branded NeatAudit:** Offered as a free member benefit (e.g. "AI Readiness Diagnostic for Law Society Members")
- **Revenue Share / Lead Attribution:** Structured for win-win monetisation
- **Education-First Framing:** Positions the partner as a trusted AI navigator—not a product pusher
- **Aggregate Insights:** Anonymous benchmarking data (e.g. "Average Friction Score for Accounting Firms") shared back with the org

We're not selling through partners—we're helping them deliver new value to their members, while capturing qualified pipeline at the point of trust.

## Use Case Mapping by Friction Signature

### Sales Flow: Free Audit → Pilot → Full Rollout

- **NeatAudit (Free):** Quantifies pain points and opportunities, providing custom output within 24 hours
- **Pilot (1–2 agents):** A 2-week deployment focused on delivering quick wins
- **Rollout:** Expansion of agents and activation of NeatPortal, followed by continuous optimization and upsell triggers

This sales process functions as a flywheel, where each successful step facilitates the next. All data across the user journey pins to a wheel that feeds right back into the cycle.

## Expansion Pathways: From Legal to Horizontal Scale

Our GTM strategy creates a compounding advantage through data-driven insights and pattern recognition. As we serve more clients across different verticals, our understanding of SME friction patterns deepens, enabling more precise targeting and faster deployment.

This expansion strategy leverages the behavioral data moat and learning flywheel described in our Differentiation & Moat section, creating a virtuous cycle of improved targeting, faster deployment, and better outcomes.
