## Sample Friction Audit Output

### Diagnostic Scoring Framework

NeatAudit is SrvdNeat's proprietary AI readiness diagnostic, specifically designed for SMEs. It features:

- A rapid 5-minute digital intake process, requiring no account setup or technical jargon
- Structure around six universal friction dimensions
- Each dimension is scored on a 1–5 severity scale, weighted by its impact and prevalence
- The output includes an Aggregate Friction Score (AFS), prioritized use cases, and an ROI-weighted intervention path

### Sample Questions by Category

- **Manual Load:** "How often do you enter the same data into multiple systems (e.g., Xero + CRM + Email)? What % of your team's time is spent on repeatable tasks?"
- **Data Fragmentation:** "How many software tools do you actively use to manage operations? Do these tools sync automatically or require manual updates?"
- **Process Opacity:** "Can you describe your workflow for onboarding a new client? Who owns each step, and is that documented?"

Each question is presented in plain English, is role-specific, and designed to extract genuine friction points rather than vague pain points.

## Sample Workflow Redesign

### Input: AFS = 4.3 | High admin in manual load, silos, billing

**Output:**
- Deploy agent to extract onboarding info from email → sync with CRM
- Auto-generate client engagement letter → trigger billing setup
- Centralize SOPs and workflows inside NeatPortal for team access

**Time-to-value:** 24–48 hours
**Projected ROI:** 270% in the first 90 days

## Industry-Specific ROI Examples

### Case Study 1: Huxley Hilltop Farms (Agriculture)
- Struggle with low motivation from seasonal workers.
- Agents favoured transparency over rules.
- Dashboard showed standouts & slouches.

### Case Study 2: Racquet Film Lab (Creative Industries)
- Automated CRM via triggers and workflows.
- 300+ manual emails, 40+ human hours/week saved
- Saving a SME $1250 AUD+ a week

### Case Study 3: Civil Engineering Workmate (Construction)
- 10+ hours per employee saved weekly
- Contract execution time halved
- Tangible ROI achieved — in less than 4 weeks.

### Case Study 4: Critical Case Assist App
- Triangulated patterns: weather, meds, symptoms
- Exportable visual data for GPs.
- Life-changing support — $10 in compute build.

**ROI Results & Industry Validation**
- Average time-to-value: 24–48 hours.
- Average ROI at 90 days: 2.5x–3.2x.
- Implementation success rate: 95%+.
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) from pilot clients: 92.

## Glossary of Terms

**Friction Index:** Proprietary scoring system that measures operational inefficiencies across six dimensions, providing a quantitative assessment of AI readiness.

**NeatAudit:** Free 5-minute diagnostic tool that identifies friction patterns and generates prioritized AI deployment roadmaps.

**NeatLM:** Intelligent orchestration engine that converts diagnostic data into tailored, business-specific AI agents.

**NeatPortal:** Continuous optimization layer that monitors performance, surfaces friction, and enables self-improving AI infrastructure.

**Aggregate Friction Score (AFS):** Composite score (1-5 scale) that quantifies an SME's operational friction and determines AI deployment readiness.

**Behavioral AI:** AI system that understands and responds to real operational behavior patterns, rather than relying on static rules or generic prompts.

**Infrastructure vs. Tools:** SrvdNeat's core philosophy that focuses on building robust operational foundations rather than adding isolated point solutions.

**LTV:CAC Ratio:** Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost ratio, measuring the efficiency of customer acquisition and retention.

**ACV:** Average Contract Value, representing the typical annual revenue per customer.
