## Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To ignite Australia's next wave of SME productivity by eradicating operational friction and unlocking scalable, intelligent automation.

**Mission:** To empower every SME to deploy AI that deliversâ€”through precise friction diagnostics, seamless execution orchestration, and deep workflow intelligence, unlocking 251% ROI and 95% success rates where others fail.

## Value Pillars & Approach

**Friction Blocks AI.** It's not tool accessâ€”it's the disarray that derails deployment.

**Infrastructure Over Tools.** We don't patch chaos; we reconstruct robust foundations for lasting AI impact.

**Behavior Unlocks Potential.** Inefficiencies follow patternsâ€”we map them to reveal actionable opportunities.

**Adoption Demands Design.** AI must mold to people, not force them to adapt.

**SMEs Merit Excellence.** They drive half the economy yet limp with makeshift fixes. We're changing that.

## Brand Positioning

**Friction reveals the problem. NeatLM delivers the upgrade. With SrvdNeat, AI compounds.**

We are not selling "AI in a box." We are building the systemic solution that makes AI truly usable and measurably valuable for real businesses. # Market Analysis

## TAM / SAM / SOM

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 2.6 million Australian SMEs lose **$38.6B annually** to operational frictionâ€”manual handoffs, lost context, fragmented systems.

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM):** 1.2 million SMEs in friction-heavy sectors: legal, finance, healthcare, NDIS, and compliance-led services. These are process-reliant businesses with clear stakes in efficiency and accuracy.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** 420,000 digitally ready firms with clear, quantified admin pain. We qualify them by a friction index: >30% of team time spent on non-billable work. At an average contract value of $33,300, this unlocks a **$14B immediate revenue opportunity** for outcome-led AI deployment.

## Target Segmentation

SrvdNeat targets SMEs that are willing but blocked. We call them:

**AI-Curious but Stuck**

They exhibit three core traits:

- **Mindset:** Want automation, but distrust generic consultants or freelance builders
- **Behavior:** Have tried AI tools (e.g. chatbots, Zapier) and quit due to complexity or low ROI
- **Conditions:** Founder-led ops, regulatory complexity, and manual workflows that break at scale

These aren't laggards. They're early adopters with friction. They don't need more AI tools â€” they need an intelligent partner to remove the blockers.

## Why Now: SrvdNeat's Moment

**AI isn't too early for SMEsâ€”it's already here, and it's already failing.**

- **65% of Australian SMEs** report stalled or failed AI projects
- **80% of owners** see AI as vital for customer reach and competitiveness
- **63% use AI weekly**, but only for shallow tasks like admin support or basic visuals

**The problem isn't interestâ€”it's integration.** SMEs are drowning in tools but starving for outcomes. Today's AI "adoption" is fragmented and tactical: vendors pitch isolated solutions that skim above broken workflows. What's missing is infrastructureâ€”the connective tissue that diagnoses friction, aligns systems, and enables AI that actually works.

## Timing Tailwinds: July 2025 Is a Generational Moment

SrvdNeat launches at the collision point of two structural shifts:

### 1. $185B Federal AI Infrastructure Initiative (July 2025)

OpenAI and the Australian Government have made a landmark commitment to **fixing SME execution barriers**â€”the exact domain SrvdNeat was built to solve.

- Focuses on SME enablement, operational readiness, and orchestration
- Attacks fragmentationâ€”not just by adding more tools
- Directly mirrors SrvdNeat's friction-first model, almost word for word

### 2. From AI Hype to AI Accountability

The market has matured. SMEs are no longer dazzled by demos:

- Prototypes don't cut it
- Leaders want embedded, measurable outcomes
- **SrvdNeat delivers execution, not theatre**

## Sector Momentum: The Wave Is Breaking Now

- **Professional Services Surge:** Legal, finance, and admin-heavy SMEs are driving an **11.4% CAGR** in automation softwareâ€”no signs of slowing
- **Government-Subsidised Adoption:** Programs like the Digital Solutions Program and Industry Growth Fund are de-risking AI investment for SMEs
- **Post-COVID Infrastructure Maturity:** Digitisation grants have primed systemsâ€”but execution still fails
- **Affordable Orchestration:** Model and infra costs are finally within SME reach
- **Workforce Pressure:** Labour shortages, burnout, and compliance fatigue are accelerating urgency

**Adoption is no longer the hurdleâ€”execution is.** AI tools are everywhere. But **with <30% success rates**, the market has made one thing clear: **tools don't transform. Infrastructure does.** # Problem Framing

## The Productivity Stall in Australian SMEs

Australia's 2.6 million SMEs collectively lose over $38.6 billion annually due to operational friction. This friction is primarily driven by:

- **Manual load:** Excessive data entry, filing, and cross-system handoffs
- **Lost context:** Inefficient communication through email chains, siloed information, and reliance on PDF-based workflows
- **Reactive processes:** Inefficient handling of compliance, client onboarding, and billing
- **Scalability blockers:** Non-standardized operations, reliance on tribal knowledge, and over-dependence on key individuals

SrvdNeat quantifies this with a proprietary Friction Index, benchmarked across six dimensions. Most SMEs score 3.2/5 or higher, indicating a critical state for AI deployment without foundational operational changes.

## Operational Friction: The Root Cause of AI Failure

AI solutions often fail not because they lack intelligence, but because they are introduced into chaotic operational environments. Most SME operations are characterized by:

- **Unstructured:** Lacking clear process ownership and relying on ad hoc tasks
- **Overloaded:** Burdened by manual workflows and constant reactive firefighting
- **Siloed:** Information and data are scattered across emails, PDFs, and legacy systems

**Australian SMEs** lose $14,857 and 541 hours a year to frictionâ€”manual handoffs, lost context, fractured data. Furthermore, Friction derails 70% of digital projects; locking 2.6M SMEs out of AI's transformative potential.

These conditions severely impede AI adoption. The technology itself is capable, but it lacks a stable foundation upon which to operate. The core failure point is not the quality of the AI model, but rather the business's execution readiness. As the saying goes, "You can't automate chaos. You have to fix it first."

## From Curiosity to Accountability: How SME AI Has Evolved

**AI isn't too early for SMEsâ€”it's already here, and it's already failing.**

- **65% of Australian SMEs** report stalled or failed AI projects
- **80% of owners** see AI as vital for customer reach and competitiveness
- **63% use AI weekly**, but only for shallow tasks like admin support or basic visuals

**The problem isn't interestâ€”it's integration.** SMEs are drowning in tools but starving for outcomes. Today's AI "adoption" is fragmented and tactical: vendors pitch isolated solutions that skim above broken workflows. What's missing is infrastructureâ€”the connective tissue that diagnoses friction, aligns systems, and enables AI that actually works.

## Broken Tools, Broken Promises: Why Vendors Fail

Most vendors offer point solutions or AI tools. SrvdNeat, however, builds essential infrastructure:

| **Category** | **AI Tooling** | **SrvdNeat Infrastructure** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Approach | Point solution (e.g., AI email writer) | Pattern engine (across operations, teams, workflows) |
| Integration | Requires SME to adapt to the tool | Learns from SME behavior and adapts to it |
| Deployment | Static agent per task | Orchestrated execution layer across systems |
| Feedback Loop | Manual retraining, reimplementation | Live feedback â†’ friction map â†’ agent tuning |
| Business Impact | Productivity spike, then drop | Compounding ROI via embedded intelligence |

We are not selling "AI in a box." We are building the systemic solution that makes AI truly usable and measurably valuable for real businesses. # Product Architecture

## Why Infrastructure Wins (When Tools Don't)

SrvdNeat fundamentally redefines the AI adoption model for SMEs. Instead of the traditional approach where AI is deployed first, leading to chaos and project stalls, our model is:

- **Traditional Model:** AI first â†’ chaos reveals itself â†’ project stalls
- **SrvdNeat Model:** Diagnose friction â†’ stabilize workflows â†’ deploy AI that sticks

## The SrvdNeat Stack Overview

A tightly integrated three-layer system designed to diagnose, deploy, and continuously improve AI inside real SME workflows.

### NeatAudit: Friction Diagnostic (Free)

**Purpose:** Identify where AI *should* be deployed
**Format:** 5-minute online assessment â†’ output within 24 hours

| **Pilot** | 1â€“2 agents deployed in 2 weeks | Fast ROI and confidence |
| **Rollout** | Full-stack orchestration + Portal | Long-term automation, zero waste |

## Why It Works (and Others Don't)

1. **We Start with Friction** â€“ Most vendors start with what they've built. We start with what's *broken*.

2. **Agents That Fit** â€“ NeatLM tailors every deployment to business-specific logic and tooling.

3. **Learning by Design** â€“ NeatPortal isn't a dashboard. It's a feedback engine that compounds ROI.

4. **Zero-Risk Entry** â€“ The free audit delivers value before any commitment. Sales friction = gone.

## Infrastructure vs. Tooling Framing

Most vendors offer point solutions or AI tools. SrvdNeat, however, builds essential infrastructure:

| **Category** | **AI Tooling** | **SrvdNeat Infrastructure** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Approach | Point solution (e.g., AI email writer) | Pattern engine (across operations, teams, workflows) |
| Integration | Requires SME to adapt to the tool | Learns from SME behavior and adapts to it |
| Deployment | Static agent per task | Orchestrated execution layer across systems |
| Feedback Loop | Manual retraining, reimplementation | Live feedback â†’ friction map â†’ agent tuning |
| Business Impact | Productivity spike, then drop | Compounding ROI via embedded intelligence |

We are not selling "AI in a box." We are building the systemic solution that makes AI truly usable and measurably valuable for real businesses. # Differentiation & Moat

## Diagnostic Scoring Framework

NeatAudit is SrvdNeat's proprietary AI readiness diagnostic, specifically designed for SMEs. It features:

- A rapid 5-minute digital intake process, requiring no account setup or technical jargon
- Structure around six universal friction dimensions
- Each dimension is scored on a 1â€“5 severity scale, weighted by its impact and prevalence
- The output includes an Aggregate Friction Score (AFS), prioritized use cases, and an ROI-weighted intervention path

### Scoring Framework

| **Dimension** | **Scoring Criteria (1â€“5 scale)** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Manual Load | Volume of repeatable, low-value tasks |
| Data Fragmentation | Number of disconnected systems + manual handoffs |
| Process Opacity | Lack of visibility, SOPs, or automation triggers |
| Audit Reactivity | Time spent reacting to compliance/client demands |
| Scalability Friction | Workflows dependent on individuals, not systems |
| Knowledge Silos | Critical information not captured, structured, or shared |

Scores are dynamically weighted based on industry, organizational size, and digital maturity.

### Sample Questions by Category

- **Manual Load:** "How often do you enter the same data into multiple systems (e.g., Xero + CRM + Email)? What % of your team's time is spent on repeatable tasks?"
- **Data Fragmentation:** "How many software tools do you actively use to manage operations? Do these tools sync automatically or require manual updates?"
- **Process Opacity:** "Can you describe your workflow for onboarding a new client? Who owns each step, and is that documented?"

Each question is presented in plain English, is role-specific, and designed to extract genuine friction points rather than vague pain points.

## Friction Index & ROI Mapping

Sample Range: 1 = Minimal Friction, 5 = Critical Barrier)

| **Dimension** | **Example (Legal SME)** | **Score** |
|---------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Manual Load | Intake forms retyped from PDFs | 4.5 |
| Data Fragmentation | Client docs in Dropbox, billing in LEAP | 4.2 |
| Process Opacity | No automated handoff from email to billing | 3.8 |
| Audit Reactivity | Compliance flagged late via email chains | 4.0 |
| Scalability Friction | Principal manually approves every document | 4.6 |
| Knowledge Silos | No shared SOPs; "we ask Sarah" for everything | 5.0 |

**Aggregate Friction Score: 4.35**
**Recommendation:** Immediate orchestration of onboarding, billing, and approval workflows.

## Pattern Memory & Adaptive Execution

Upon completion of an audit, NeatLM generates a tailored solution path. For instance:

**Input:** AFS = 4.3 | High admin in manual load, silos, billing

**Output:**
- Deploy agent to extract onboarding info from email â†’ sync with CRM
- Auto-generate client engagement letter â†’ trigger billing setup
- Centralize SOPs and workflows inside NeatPortal for team access

**Time-to-value:** 24â€“48 hours
**Projected ROI:** 270% in the first 90 days

## Behavioral Data Moat

Our defensibility is rooted in pattern density, not merely intellectual property. This is achieved through:

- **NeatAudit Fingerprint:** Each NeatAudit generates a unique fingerprint of how SMEs operate
- **Friction Cluster Identification:** NeatLM leverages this data to identify friction clusters across various industries
- **Smarter Interventions:** Interventions become increasingly intelligent with each rollout
- **Continuously Tuned Playbooks:** Playbooks are templated but are continuously fine-tuned for each segment

## Learning Flywheel & Long-Term Defensibility

As our client base expands, we compound three distinct advantages:

- **Pattern Density:** Every audit refines our understanding of SME friction, leading to the evolution of segment-specific playbooks derived from real-world data
- **Instruction Optimization:** Our agents continuously improve their execution across various use cases, not just within individual companies. This reduces deployment effort and error rates
- **Predictive Intervention:** Friction signatures enable preemptive solution nudges. For example, a system prompt might alert a user: "You're about to hit a billing bottleneckâ€”would you like suggested paths forward?"

We are not merely adding features; we are systematically upgrading the SME nervous system, one workflow at a time. # Go-To-Market Strategy

## Entry via Free Audit Model

Our Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy is structured in phases to ensure sustainable growth and market penetration:

- **0â€“6 Months (Validation):** Focus on founder-led sales and securing initial pilot wins. Target Outcome: $250K ARR from 10â€“12 clients
- **6â€“12 Months (Scale):** Develop a robust content engine and test various channel strategies. Target Outcome: $1M ARR run-rate, with established playbook repeatability
- **12â€“24 Months (Distribution):** Implement partner programs and further automate sales processes. Target Outcome: $2M ARR, preparing for a Series A funding round

This phased execution ensures early product-market fit, followed by scalable growth through predictable friction segments.

## Sales Channels & Partner Plays

### Partnerships
Collaboration with member organizations (e.g., Law Society, Accounting bodies) to offer white-labeled NeatAudit for trusted distribution. This includes shared-revenue or bundled offers.

SrvdNeat enhances associations and networks by giving them actionable AI value to pass on to membersâ€”without the risk of recommending generic tooling. Benefits include:

- **Branded NeatAudit:** Offered as a free member benefit (e.g. "AI Readiness Diagnostic for Law Society Members")
- **Revenue Share / Lead Attribution:** Structured for win-win monetisation
- **Education-First Framing:** Positions the partner as a trusted AI navigatorâ€”not a product pusher
- **Aggregate Insights:** Anonymous benchmarking data (e.g. "Average Friction Score for Accounting Firms") shared back with the org

We're not selling through partnersâ€”we're helping them deliver new value to their members, while capturing qualified pipeline at the point of trust.

## Use Case Mapping by Friction Signature

### Sales Flow: Free Audit â†’ Pilot â†’ Full Rollout

- **NeatAudit (Free):** Quantifies pain points and opportunities, providing custom output within 24 hours
- **Pilot (1â€“2 agents):** A 2-week deployment focused on delivering quick wins
- **Rollout:** Expansion of agents and activation of NeatPortal, followed by continuous optimization and upsell triggers

This sales process functions as a flywheel, where each successful step facilitates the next. All data across the user journey pins to a wheel that feeds right back into the cycle.

## Expansion Pathways: From Legal to Horizontal Scale

As our client base expands, we compound three distinct advantages:

- **Pattern Density:** Every audit refines our understanding of SME friction, leading to the evolution of segment-specific playbooks derived from real-world data
- **Instruction Optimization:** Our agents continuously improve their execution across various use cases, not just within individual companies. This reduces deployment effort and error rates
- **Predictive Intervention:** Friction signatures enable preemptive solution nudges. For example, a system prompt might alert a user: "You're about to hit a billing bottleneckâ€”would you like suggested paths forward?" # Competitive Landscape

## Direct & Indirect Competitors

Of Australia's **744 AI vendors, only 17% focus on deployment.** Within that group, **85% chase generative AI** trends while **just 15% solve operational friction**. SrvdNeat dominates the NLP execution gap that generative AI vendors can't fill.

### Positioning Matrix

| **Vendor Type** | **Example Companies** | **Limitation** | **SrvdNeat Advantage** |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Generic AI Tools | ChatGPT, Notion AI | No business logic, no orchestration | Behavioral logic layer with tailored agents |
| SME Automation | Zapier, Make.com | Requires technical setup, brittle workflows | Pre-mapped playbooks, no-code agent deployment |
| Vertical SaaS | Clio, LEAP, Xero | Solves one slice, creates silos elsewhere | Cross-platform pattern engine |
| AI Consultancies | Deloitte, Accenture | High-cost, slow, not scalable to SMEs | Fast, repeatable, data-backed interventions |

SrvdNeat distinguishes itself as infrastructure. It unifies, adapts, and learnsâ€”rather than simply adding another tool into an already chaotic environment.

### Direct vs. Indirect Competitors

| **Type** | **Company** | **Our Take** |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Direct: Orchestration | Bardeen, Relevance AI | Focused on tech-savvy users or enterprises |
| Indirect: SaaS AI | Jasper, Copy.ai | Feature-specific, non-integrated |
| Indirect: Consultants | Fractional AI CXOs | Not scalable, no IP flywheel |
| Adjacent: Ops Tools | ClickUp, Asana | Not AI-native, require manual configuration |

SrvdNeat gains a competitive edge by combining orchestration, context awareness, and compounding data within a system that continuously learns from every deployment.

## Why SrvdNeat Can't Be Bundled, Replaced, or Ignored

### Behavioral Data Moat

Our defensibility is rooted in pattern density, not merely intellectual property. This is achieved through:

- **NeatAudit Fingerprint:** Each NeatAudit generates a unique fingerprint of how SMEs operate
- **Friction Cluster Identification:** NeatLM leverages this data to identify friction clusters across various industries
- **Smarter Interventions:** Interventions become increasingly intelligent with each rollout
- **Continuously Tuned Playbooks:** Playbooks are templated but are continuously fine-tuned for each segment

### Future Threats & Moat Preservation

As the SME AI market matures, we anticipate three categories of competitive threat:

1. **Vertical SaaS Tools Adding AI Layers**
   - Tools like Xero, Clio, and LEAP may embed AI features, but they will remain feature-bound and siloed
   - **SrvdNeat Advantage:** We orchestrate *across* systems, not within themâ€”making us complementary, not redundant

2. **Enterprise AI Orchestration Platforms Moving Downmarket**
   - Players like UiPath, Relevance AI, or custom consultant stacks may attempt SME targeting
   - **SrvdNeat Advantage:** Our product, pricing, and UX are purpose-built for SME velocityâ€”low-code interfaces, rapid time-to-value, and no integration debt

3. **Generic Copilots with Workflow Plugins (e.g., Microsoft, Google)**
   - These tools will drive automation awareness but lack tailored context logic
   - **SrvdNeat Advantage:** Our moat is behavioralâ€”the friction data, context maps, and adaptive agent logic trained across real-world SME operations. This isn't a plugin layer. It's infrastructure

**Our defense isn't just IPâ€”it's inertia.**

The more clients we serve, the smarter our orchestration becomesâ€”and the more painful it is to rip us out. This represents infrastructure-level learningâ€”a dynamic map of SME behavior in motion, rather than static rules. Over time, SrvdNeat is poised to become the default pattern library for SME AI orchestration. # Business Model & Economics

## Pricing Tiers & ACV Breakdown

SrvdNeat employs a tiered subscription model designed to scale with the complexity of SME operations, rather than simply headcount. The key changes per tier are as followed:

- **Core:** internal, non-branded AI efficiency tools (frameworks to amplify effective work)
- **Plus:** internal, branded AI efficiency tools (internal infranet/chat etc)
- **App/Scale:** Outward facing, branded AI deployments

| **Tier** | **Monthly** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Core | $1.5K | Basic agent deployment + NeatPortal access |
| Plus | $3K | Multi-agent orchestration + industry templates |
| App/Scale | $4.5K+ | Full orchestration, comprehensive support, and compliance wrap |

- **Blended ACV:** $33.3K AUD
- **Average onboarding to activation:** Less than 7 days
- **Average agent deployment timeline:** 24â€“48 hours

Our pricing is value-anchored: clients pay for the measurable elimination of friction, not for arbitrary "seats" or "features" or unpredictable, often-spiking API pings.

## Unit Economics & Payback Period

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Gross Margin | 85% |
| CAC (est. Year 1) | $7.9K |
| LTV | $100K |
| LTV:CAC | 4.2x |
| Payback Period | 8 months |

Efficiency is projected to increase post-raise due to the maturation of our Go-to-Market (GTM) engine and enhanced agent reuse. Our high margin is protected by an in-house orchestration engine, minimizing reliance on outsourced development.

## Revenue Forecast & Customer Ramp

| **Month** | **Clients** | **Monthly ARR** | **Annual ARR** | **Cumulative Revenue** | **Key Milestones** |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|

| 30 | 80 | $222,000 | $2.664M | $3.16M | Network effect kicks in |
| 36 | 110 | $305,250 | $3.663M | $5.9M | Vertical dominance begins |

- **Average Contract Value (ACV):** $33.3K
- **Gross Margin:** 85%
- **Revenue Mix:** 90% recurring, 10% setup/custom integrations
- **Break-even:** Approximately Month 20

## Capital Efficiency & Use of Funds

### $2M Seed Round Allocation

| **Category** | **Allocation** | **Amount (AUD)** | **Strategic Purpose** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Go-to-Market (GTM)** | 50% | $1,000,000 | Build repeatable acquisition engine: content, lead gen, sales automation, partnerships |
| **Infrastructure** | 20% | $400,000 | Scale NeatLM orchestration, deploy agent chaining, invest in data infrastructure |
| **Team Expansion** | 20% | $400,000 | Hire CTO and Head of Growth + support roles to scale product and GTM delivery |
| **Operating Buffer** | 10% | $200,000 | Preserve 24-month runway; ensure flexibility for reallocation based on signal |

This allocation is intentionally biased toward **distribution and delivery**, not experimentation. The model is working. This capital scales what's already proven.

### Land > Expand > Compound Model

- **Land:** Initiate with a free NeatAudit to quantify and highlight potential ROI during the initial meeting. Deploy 1â€“2 high-impact agents (e.g., for onboarding, billing, or compliance)
- **Expand:** Introduce multi-agent workflows (e.g., integrating onboarding â†’ billing â†’ follow-up processes). Activate NeatPortal for client-side usage and deeper engagement
- **Compound:** Behavioral data continuously feeds our learning loop. Usage patterns trigger new intervention prompts, and margins expand without a proportional increase in headcount

This model creates a virtuous cycle: the more clients we serve, the more precise our interventions become, and the faster we can acquire new clients. # Team & Execution Plan

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| **Risk** | **Severity** | **Mitigation** | **Contingency Plan** |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| GTM Underperformance | High | Phased rollout, lean pilots, warm channels, and founder-led sales in early stages | Reduce burn; extend free audit period; pivot to most engaged verticals |
| Talent Acquisition (CTO) | Medium | Pre-qualified candidates; interim advisory oversight in place | Interim fractional CTO or contract tech lead if hiring cycle lags |
| Model Drift / AI Quality | Medium | Real-time QA layer; human-in-the-loop fallbacks; structured feedback loop via NeatPortal | Revert to versioned prompts; enforce stricter fallback routing thresholds |
| Compliance / Data Risk | Medium | Local data tenancy (AU), SOC2 Type I alignment, legal advisory retainer in place | Accelerate internal audit; segment high-sensitivity clients by tenancy |
| Market Timing Slips | Low | Friction-first foundation remains relevant regardless of hype cycles or adoption pace | Focus on cost-saving messaging over AI enablement; use downtime to widen moat |

### Operational & Market Dynamics

- SMEs can be slow to act â†’ We lead with a free Friction Audit to remove inertia and prove ROI up front
- Some verticals require education â†’ We target pain-qualified niches (legal, finance, HR) with existing urgency
- Competitor noise will grow â†’ Our moat compounds through usageâ€”not hypeâ€”via proprietary friction pattern data

### External Risk Considerations

- **Economic Downturns** â†’ SrvdNeat directly reduces headcount pressure and cost overheadâ€”making it more valuable in lean times
- **Regulatory Shifts** â†’ Local-first architecture, SOC2 roadmap, and modular tenancy design protect against emerging data restrictions

We do not require perfect market conditions. Our approach is grounded in operational reality, proven need, and modular executionâ€”positioning us to win through both upturns and headwinds. # Financials

## Sample Friction Audit Output

### Diagnostic Scoring Framework

NeatAudit is SrvdNeat's proprietary AI readiness diagnostic, specifically designed for SMEs. It features:

- A rapid 5-minute digital intake process, requiring no account setup or technical jargon
- Structure around six universal friction dimensions
- Each dimension is scored on a 1â€“5 severity scale, weighted by its impact and prevalence
- The output includes an Aggregate Friction Score (AFS), prioritized use cases, and an ROI-weighted intervention path

### Sample Questions by Category

- **Manual Load:** "How often do you enter the same data into multiple systems (e.g., Xero + CRM + Email)? What % of your team's time is spent on repeatable tasks?"
- **Data Fragmentation:** "How many software tools do you actively use to manage operations? Do these tools sync automatically or require manual updates?"
- **Process Opacity:** "Can you describe your workflow for onboarding a new client? Who owns each step, and is that documented?"

Each question is presented in plain English, is role-specific, and designed to extract genuine friction points rather than vague pain points.

## Sample Workflow Redesign

### Input: AFS = 4.3 | High admin in manual load, silos, billing

**Output:**
- Deploy agent to extract onboarding info from email â†’ sync with CRM
- Auto-generate client engagement letter â†’ trigger billing setup
