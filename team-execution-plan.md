# Team & Execution Plan

## Founding Team

### Sam Attwood â€“ Founder & CEO

Two-time startup founder with successful exits. Strong background in behavioral psychology and automation, coupled with over 10 years of experience in brand development, AI operations, and SME transformation. Built SrvdNeat from inception, securing paying clients even before the codebase was fully stable, demonstrating sharp capabilities in distribution, brand-led Go-to-Market (GTM), and execution psychology.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed proprietary friction diagnostic methodology
- Secured early revenue without full product
- Validated behavioral AI approach across multiple verticals
- Built SrvdNeat from concept to paying clients through word-of-mouth alone

## Strategic Advisors & Hiring Roadmap

### Martyn Reeves - Lead Advisor (GTM)
SaaS exec with 40+ years scaling B2B across US, EU, and AU. Now backing Australia's next breakout layer as recognized angel investor. Brings deep expertise in scaling SaaS companies through early growth phases and establishing repeatable GTM engines.

### Key Roles Post-Raise

| **Role** | **Timing** | **Purpose** |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| CTO | At raise | Owns technical roadmap, security, and infrastructure scale |
| Brand Manager | Month 3-4 | Builds out sales automation and partner engine |
| Product Manager | Month 6+ | Oversees agent deployment, tuning, and quality assurance (QA) loop |

Our hiring strategy is focused on compounding execution, not merely adding headcount.

## 36-Month Execution Milestones

### Platform v1.0 â†’ v4.0

| **Version** | **Key Milestones** | **Status** |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| v1.0 | Core audit engine, first-generation agent deployments | âœ… Launched |
| v1.5 | NeatPortal MVP (team dashboard + SOP delivery) | âœ… Live |
| v2.0 | Agent chaining + logic branching | ðŸ”„ In dev |
| v3.0 | Contextual memory + agent reuse across clients | Q1 2026 |
| v4.0 | Fully autonomous orchestration loop + user-trained logic | Q3 2026 |

Each successive version is designed to enhance stickiness, increase Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) per client, and strengthen our defensibility.

### 24-Month Milestones

| **Month** | **Target** | **ARR** |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| 6 | 10 clients live | $333K ARR |
| 12 | 25 clients, playbook refined | $832K ARR |
| 24 | 60 clients, vertical expansion underway | $2.0M ARR |

These milestones lock in product-market fit, unlock channel scale, and position us for a high-conviction Series A.

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| **Risk** | **Severity** | **Mitigation** | **Contingency Plan** |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| GTM Underperformance | High | Phased rollout, lean pilots, warm channels, and founder-led sales in early stages | Reduce burn; extend free audit period; pivot to most engaged verticals |
| Talent Acquisition (CTO) | Medium | Pre-qualified candidates; interim advisory oversight in place | Interim fractional CTO or contract tech lead if hiring cycle lags |
| Model Drift / AI Quality | Medium | Real-time QA layer; human-in-the-loop fallbacks; structured feedback loop via NeatPortal | Revert to versioned prompts; enforce stricter fallback routing thresholds |
| Compliance / Data Risk | Medium | Local data tenancy (AU), SOC2 Type I alignment, legal advisory retainer in place | Accelerate internal audit; segment high-sensitivity clients by tenancy |
| Market Timing Slips | Low | Friction-first foundation remains relevant regardless of hype cycles or adoption pace | Focus on cost-saving messaging over AI enablement; use downtime to widen moat |

### Operational & Market Dynamics

- SMEs can be slow to act â†’ We lead with a free Friction Audit to remove inertia and prove ROI up front
- Some verticals require education â†’ We target pain-qualified niches (legal, finance, HR) with existing urgency
- Competitor noise will grow â†’ Our moat compounds through usageâ€”not hypeâ€”via proprietary friction pattern data

### External Risk Considerations

- **Economic Downturns** â†’ SrvdNeat directly reduces headcount pressure and cost overheadâ€”making it more valuable in lean times
- **Regulatory Shifts** â†’ Local-first architecture, SOC2 roadmap, and modular tenancy design protect against emerging data restrictions

We do not require perfect market conditions. Our approach is grounded in operational reality, proven need, and modular executionâ€”positioning us to win through both upturns and headwinds.
