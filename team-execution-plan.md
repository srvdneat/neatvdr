# Team & Execution Plan

## Execution Strategy

Building on our strong founding team and strategic advisors (see Team & Advisors section), our execution plan focuses on systematic scaling and risk mitigation.

### Key Roles Post-Raise

| **Role** | **Timing** | **Purpose** |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| CTO | At raise | Owns technical roadmap, security, and infrastructure scale |
| Brand Manager | Month 3-4 | Builds out sales automation and partner engine |
| Product Manager | Month 6+ | Oversees agent deployment, tuning, and quality assurance (QA) loop |

Our hiring strategy is focused on compounding execution, not merely adding headcount.

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| **Risk** | **Severity** | **Mitigation** | **Contingency Plan** |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| GTM Underperformance | High | Phased rollout, lean pilots, warm channels, and founder-led sales in early stages | Reduce burn; extend free audit period; pivot to most engaged verticals |
| Talent Acquisition (CTO) | Medium | Pre-qualified candidates; interim advisory oversight in place | Interim fractional CTO or contract tech lead if hiring cycle lags |
| Model Drift / AI Quality | Medium | Real-time QA layer; human-in-the-loop fallbacks; structured feedback loop via NeatPortal | Revert to versioned prompts; enforce stricter fallback routing thresholds |
| Compliance / Data Risk | Medium | Local data tenancy (AU), SOC2 Type I alignment, legal advisory retainer in place | Accelerate internal audit; segment high-sensitivity clients by tenancy |
| Market Timing Slips | Low | Friction-first foundation remains relevant regardless of hype cycles or adoption pace | Focus on cost-saving messaging over AI enablement; use downtime to widen moat |

### Operational & Market Dynamics

- SMEs can be slow to act → We lead with a free Friction Audit to remove inertia and prove ROI up front
- Some verticals require education → We target pain-qualified niches (legal, finance, HR) with existing urgency
- Competitor noise will grow → Our moat compounds through usage—not hype—via proprietary friction pattern data

### External Risk Considerations

- **Economic Downturns** → SrvdNeat directly reduces headcount pressure and cost overhead—making it more valuable in lean times
- **Regulatory Shifts** → Local-first architecture, SOC2 roadmap, and modular tenancy design protect against emerging data restrictions

We do not require perfect market conditions. Our approach is grounded in operational reality, proven need, and modular execution—positioning us to win through both upturns and headwinds.
