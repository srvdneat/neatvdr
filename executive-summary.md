**Our Solution:** A 5-minute **Friction Audit** uncovers 60+ behavioral signals, revealing hidden inefficiencies and prioritizing high-ROI automations. Within 48 hours, **NeatLM** deploys adaptive, self-optimizing AI workflows—yielding seamless integration even in legacy setups.

**Infrastructure Over Tools:** We don't patch chaos; we reconstruct robust foundations for lasting AI impact. Our behavioral AI is built to understand and respond to friction patterns that derail 70% of digital projects.

## Traction Without a Prototype

We secured $75K from three inbound clients (plus a $10K unsolicited gift) through word-of-mouth alone—100% conversion on initial conversations, spanning untapped verticals like engineering and agriculture. This validates demand: SMEs crave outcomes, not experiments.

**Pilot Results:** Average time-to-value: 24–48 hours. Average ROI at 90 days: 2.5x–3.2x. Implementation success rate: 95%+. Net Promoter Score from pilot clients: 92.

## Market Catalyst

OpenAI's $185B Australian investment creates unprecedented SME AI demand—we alone solve the friction barrier preventing adoption. We're poised to capture a $10–15B opportunity by eliminating AI's biggest killer: unaddressed friction.

**Timing Tailwinds:** The market has matured. SMEs are no longer dazzled by demos—they want embedded, measurable outcomes. SrvdNeat delivers execution, not theatre.

## The Ask

Raising **$2M seed** to fuel our GTM engine and behavioral AI stack, targeting **$4.5M ARR in 24 months**. Partner with us to redefine SME productivity—where AI doesn't fail, it accelerates.
